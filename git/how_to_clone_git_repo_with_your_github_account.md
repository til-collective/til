# How to Clone a GitHub Repository with your Github account

Github is public, so its possible to clone a github account with no account or any other bitbucket account etc. In order to clone a github repository with your own github account use the following command

```git
git clone https://USERNAME@github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME.git
```

This command will force the your own github account to be used for commits and clones.
